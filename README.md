# AntiPiracySupport

ATTN: the second iteration of this service will be renamed to ContentGuard and moved to an organization at
https://github.com/ContentGuard.  If you'd like to get involved just ask and we will add you to the project!

NOTE:
Please report new piracy markets and malware to me or any of the others involved with this project.  Pull
requests are also welcome. For ROM developers interested in using this it makes more sense to track this 
project directly and then bridge into an existing package with correct perms (like settings).  This way 
any changes made here to the blacklisted packages and improvements will reach out to everyone.
